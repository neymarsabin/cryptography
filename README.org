#+TITLE: Cesar's Cipher Bash implementation
#+OPTIONS: num:nil toc:nil H:1
#+DESCRIPTION: Cipher character by shifting nth place

* Intro
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet
  #+END_QUOTE
* Technique 
  - Translating the letters to all lower case
  - Reading input from a file
  - Finding ascii decimal value of all the letters
  - adding the key value to the ascii value
  - converting the new ascii decimal value to alphabet
  - print the alphabet

* Formula:
  If x = number represented by char(a=0,b=1...) & n = shift value,
  then shifted cypher E_n(x) is given by:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    E_n(x) = (x + n) % 26
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Eg:
  To encrypt  the text _THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG_ 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ./caesar_cipher_revised.sh 
Enter your plain text: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Enter shift ciper count: 23
started cyphering...
qeb nrfzh yoltk clu grjmp lsbo qeb ixwv ald
Done cyphering !!
#+END_EXAMPLE

  and to revert it back, we just re-encrypt it by 3, but ouput will be
  all in lowercase ;)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./caesar_cipher_revised.sh
Enter your plain text: qeb nrfzh yoltk clu grjmp lsbo qeb ixwv ald
Enter shift ciper count: 3
started cyphering...
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Done cyphering !!
#+END_EXAMPLE
